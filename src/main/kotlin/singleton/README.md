# Singleton Pattern

## Purpose
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only **one instance** throughout the application's lifecycle and provides a **global point of access** to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful for managing shared resources, such as configurations, database connections, or network services, where multiple instances could cause inconsistencies or resource conflicts.

## Benefits of Singleton Pattern
- **Controlled Access**: Ensures only one instance of the class exists, preventing conflicts in shared resources.
- **Global Access Point**: Offers a simple way to access the instance from anywhere in the application.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Many implementations allow for lazy initialization, creating the instance only when needed.
