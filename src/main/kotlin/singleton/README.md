# Singleton Pattern

## Purpose
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only **one instance** throughout the application's lifecycle and provides a **global point of access** to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful for managing shared resources, such as configurations, database connections, or network services, where multiple instances could cause inconsistencies or resource conflicts.

## Benefits of Singleton Pattern
- **Controlled Access**: Ensures only one instance of the class exists, preventing conflicts in shared resources.
- **Global Access Point**: Offers a simple way to access the instance from anywhere in the application.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Many implementations allow for lazy initialization, creating the instance only when needed.

## How It Works in Kotlin:
In Kotlin, you can create a singleton by using the object keyword. This keyword automatically creates a single instance of a class, without the need for explicit instantiation or additional code.

## Why Use Singleton?

### 1. Shared Resource Management
For components like **databases** or **network clients**, having a single instance helps in managing resources more efficiently. This prevents the overhead and potential issues associated with multiple instances accessing the same resource.

### 2. Global Access
The Singleton Pattern provides a **global access point** to a single, consistent instance. This simplifies access across the application, as all parts of the app refer to the same instance, ensuring consistency in behavior and data.

### 3. Thread Safety
In Kotlin, the `object` declaration makes singletons **thread-safe by default**. This means you donâ€™t need additional synchronization to ensure that the instance is only created once, even in multi-threaded environments.
